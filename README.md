## Setup
First, on your robot:
```
$ git clone https://git.io/rovercode.git
```
Then, on your PC or tablet, point your browser to your robot's IP address.

*A very nice install.sh is is coming soon. For now, use the [install instructions](https://github.com/aninternetof/rovercode/wiki/Getting-Set-Up) to set up dependencies.*

## Description
rovercode allows you to control a robot, sense the robot's enivornment, and watch from an onboard camera.

rovercode is a webservice that you host from your robot. Currently, it can run on NextThingCo CHIP, Raspberry Pi, and BeagleBone Black (basically anything supported by the [Adafruit Python GPIO wrapper library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_GPIO)).

In your browser, you design the code using [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/). Then, your browser interprets it into Javascript and executes it (in a sandbox of course). Motor commands are sent from your browswer to the robot, and real-time sensor information is sent from the robot to the browser.
