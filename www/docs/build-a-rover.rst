build a rover
===============

future plans
-------------
We are developing a rover reference design that includes a `custom daughter
board <https://upverter.com/ductape/084de978df61d3cb/rovercode/>`_, a Lexan
chassis, and `MEMS IR sensors
<https://upverter.com/ductape/aef33f7c39fd29d5/rovercode-prox-sensor/>`_. Join
the #hardware channel of `our Slack <http://chat.rovercode.com>`_ to
follow our progress and suggest ideas.

In the meantime, you can still build a rover like the one we built as our
first prototype. In that approach, you borrow the chassis, motors, and motor
driver circuitry from an easily-hackable RC car! Instructions for doing so
are below.

chassis, motor, wheels -- the Thunder Tumbler
-----------------------------------------------

infrared sensors -- the ears
-----------------------------

install rovercode service
--------------------------

webcam -- the eye
-------------------
